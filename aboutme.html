          <p class = "title">Where I'm at Right Now</p>
          <p>I am currently in my third year majoring in User Experience Design at the University of Michigan School of Information with a minor in Spanish. I have past internship experience as a Web UI Designer for a collaborative research platform called 1Cademy. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="title">My Journey to UX</p>
          <p>In my sophomore year of high school, I elected to take a graphic design class and immediately fell in love with it. I learned quickly, and would often give myself extra projects, like an antelope with cantaloupe for ears (called a “cantaloupe”). As much as I loved the work, I had trouble finding a way to apply my love for graphic design to the real world, as well as understanding how I would be able to make a career using those skills. I highly value an intellectually stimulating challenge in my work, and I had trouble finding that in graphic design work. Then, in October of my freshman year at UofM, I learned about UX design and the School of Information, and I was hooked. Through this career path, I would be able to take my love for design to the next level by mixing both functionality and aesthetics. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="title">When I’m Not Designing, You Can Find Me</p>
          <p>Learning new languages! I am functionally fluent in Spanish but I am still learning and taking classes. I also intend to take my Spanish knowledge and learn a few romance languages that are similar to Spanish, such as Italian or Portuguese. Also, I am teaching myself ASL in my free time. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Hiking National Parks! One of my favorite things to do is go hiking in National Parks with my friends and family. I have always found it extremely beneficial to my mental health to get outside and appreciate the beauty of the natural world! One of my life goals is to be able to go to every single US National Park. My current favorites are Glacier, Acadia, and Zion. </p>
