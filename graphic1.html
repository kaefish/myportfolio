        <p class="title">Minimalist Weather App</p>
        <p>The goal of this design was to create a minimalist weather app with only a few elements: weather, temperature, location and time. I also was tasked with creating a way for users to see a difference in time-of-day, as indicated with the dark mode on the right. I tried to keep the design as simple as possible, using very few colors and making the weather drawing the main focus of the page. </p>

            <p>The purpose of this design was to provide an opportunity for members of my organization to participate in spreading awareness about low literacy levels in the United States. It inspired members to make a personal connection to our literacy philanthropy, which would help them become more excited about participating in the cause to spark change in literacy. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I used the Pi Beta Phi brand guidelines with the colors: wine and silver blue. The design choice was made to demonstrate the 1 out of 4 using childrens images to elicit a strong emotional reaction and help them understand that these are real children. </p>

            <p>The goal of this design was to make people aware of the book drive my organization had started for a local elementary school. It presents a call to action for viewers to participate in the book drive, as well as information on why these books were necessary for the school. Again, I used different shades of wine and silver blue, the pi beta phi colors, to meet brand guidelines.   </p>

            <p class="title">Microscope Brand Design</p>
            <p>Microscope's founder wanted to provide an app that gave consumers up-to-date reviews on cosmetics and information on toxicity. However, the company was a start-up and had little to no current branding. Through creative and competitive market research and many iterations, we were able to provide a logo, typeface, and mission statement for the start-up. The colors we chose reflect a natural but beautiful brand tone. </p>

            <p class="title">Fall Concert Promotional Flyer</p>
            <p>Another student and I were commissioned to design a poster and pamphlet cover for a fall concert. Our client asked us to design something that mixed both fall and Broadway themes. After many iterations, we chose this design, nicknamed "Pumpkin Head," because the letters of Broadway as well as the kick line demonstrated the show, whereas the pumpkins added a fun fall element.  </p>
