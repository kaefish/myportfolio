            <p>The purpose of this design was to provide an opportunity for members of my organization to participate in spreading awareness about low literacy levels in the United States. It inspired members to make a personal connection to our literacy philanthropy, which would help them become more excited about participating in the cause to spark change in literacy. </p>

            <p>The goal of this design was to make people aware of the book drive my organization had started for a local elementary school. It presents a call to action for viewers to participate in the book drive, as well as information on why these books were necessary for the school.  </p>

            <p class="title">Microscope Brand Design</p>
            <p>Microscope's founder wanted to provide an app that gave consumers up-to-date reviews on cosmetics and information on toxicity. However, the company was a start-up and had little to no current branding. Through creative and competitive market research and many iterations, we were able to provide a logo, typeface, and mission statement for the start-up. The colors we chose reflect a natural but beautiful brand tone. </p>

            <p class="title">Fall Concert Promotional Flyer</p>
            <p>Another student and I were commissioned to design a poster and pamphlet cover for a fall concert. Our client asked us to design something that mixed both fall and Broadway themes. After many iterations, we chose this design, nicknamed "Pumpkin Head," because the letters of Broadway as well as the kick line demonstrated the show, whereas the pumpkins added a fun fall element.  </p>
