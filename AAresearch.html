        <h1>Ann Arbor City Hall</h1>
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <div class = left>
            <p class="title">The Challenge</p>
            <p>In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 crisis put a halt on all in-person interactions including City Hall. As the rate of new cases began to decline, the city of Ann Arbor was attempting to adopt a gradual reopening process. During this situation, it was crucial to take advantage of technology in order to ease the issue. In May, my team used user research to determine how the local government could use available technology to educate a larger audience about government services and keep them engaged. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Timeline: 1 month, May 2020</p>
            <p>Role: User Researcher</p>
            <p>Tools: surveys, user interviews, affinity diagrams, user journeys, empathy mapping</p>
            <br>
            <p class="title">User Research</p>
            <p>First, our team worked on understanding Ann Arbor resident’s views on City Hall through a survey, and received 383 responses. The purpose of this survey was to better understand demographics, City Hall experiences, and methods used to stay informed on local issues/government.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is some of the most important data we received from this survey:</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">Staying informed</p>
            <p>49.6% of respondents stay informed about Ann Arbor through social media. </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">City Hall updates</p>
            <p>54.9% of respondents want to receive updates about business with City Hall through email. </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">City Hall efficiency</p>
            <p>69.2% of respondents think that efficiency in completing their business is one of the most important aspects of visiting City Hall.  </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">City Hall understanding</p>
            <p>52.5% of respondents think that understanding required fees and documents before going to City Hall is important for their visit.  </p>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
          <img src = "img/AA1.png" alt= "Survey Responses" class="page-image">
        </div>
        <div class= "left">
            <p>Once we had basic information from surveys, we conducted interviews to deepen understanding of how the residents feel about the current and future city hall through a combination of building rapport, engagement, and follow ups. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout this process, I switched-off between the roles of interviewer and note-taker. As an interviewer, I followed our interview plan, while also asking follow-up questions on the spot to ask an interviewee to delve deeper into their experience for us. </p>
            <br>
            <p>From the interviews, a few different themes became clear:</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">Efficiency</p>
            <p>Residents desire efficiency when completing business related to City Hall </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">Online interaction </p>
            <p>Many residents enjoy the ability to complete City Hall business online.  </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">Providing normal services</p>
            <p>Residents want City Hall to provide normal services throughout the pandemic.  </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "italic">Taxes</p>
            <p>Many residents we interviewed believed their taxes are too high </p>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
          <img src = "img/AA2.jpg" alt= "Framework Examples" class="page-image">
        </div>
        <div class= "left">
          <p class="title"> Insight Development</p>
          <p>The team ended up determining three insights from our user research for increasing efficiency and engagement in Ann Arbor City Hall. The insight I worked most extensively on developing was “Many residents believe that online services are more efficient than in person”. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <img src = "img/journey.jpg" alt= "Journey Map" class="page-image">
        </div>
        <div class = "left">
          <p>We also determined that efficiency of transactions between citizens and City Hall is important for creating a more satisfied community of residents. The survey responses show that 70% of residents consider “efficiency in completing their business” to be one of the most important aspects of visiting City Hall. An interviewee expressed their appreciation for City Hall’s efficiency, “They were back to me in less than five minutes with an answer and had everything all taken care of”. The above findings clearly imply that citizens crave quick and meaningful transactions associated with City Hall.</p>
          <br>
          <p> Both survey and interview responses made us realize that people preferred online interactions with City Hall, even outside of the pandemic. A majority of surveyed residents stated that they prefer online methods for both communication and business. Also, of the two people interviewed, both had agreed that online outlets were more efficient for various reasons. Jane D. stated that the ease of use and time were important to her when processing bills. John D. enjoyed the feedback process as well as the simplicity involved with online payment. The online method allowed him to avoid wasted time going to City Hall. The combination of the aforementioned examples shows how accessibility of technology, as well as the desire for efficiency in their most frequent services, can provide residents with a more satisfactory City Hall experience because they prefer online over in-person methods.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our other insights included that residents did not fully understand City Hall services, and they are also unaware of where to access online engagement opportunities. </p>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class= "left">
            <p class="title"> Opportunities</p>
            <p>After presenting our findings and insights to City Hall, we suggested a few possible opportunities for them to take these insights to build a better experience. For one, City Hall could expand their online interaction tasks to more than just paying bills and parking tickets. For example, they could make it possible to apply for permits online. We also recommended that they create a central location for citizens to access information on updates and press releases from City Hall, so they can stay well-informed during times like the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

          <p class = "title">What I learned</p>
          <p>This was my first opportunity using tools to understand user feedback. I learned how to interpret user research using user journeys, empathy mapping, and affinity diagrams and build insights from these tools.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>I also learned how to build user surveys and conduct interviews to be able to get the best understanding of the user experience possible. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Finally, I found that although online user research presents opportunities to reach more possible users, it also inhibits users without internet access from being a part of the study, even though they are Ann Arbor citizens just as much as anyone else. I believe that having their feedback may have changed the insights we ended up with.</p>
