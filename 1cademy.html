            <p class="title">The Challenge</p>
            <p>During my internship of Summer 2020, I was tasked with creating a light mode version of 1Cademy. Originally designed in a dark mode format, many users were requesting a light mode version so that they could do work in brighter settings. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Timeline: 2 months, Summer 2020</p>
            <p>Role: Web UI designer and Developer</p>
            <p>Tools: Figma</p>

            <p class="title">About 1Cademy</p>
            <p>1Cademy is a is an intelligent research tool designed to promote idea mapping and collaboration between researchers. During the summer of 2020, the number of users on 1Cademy increased drastically as a cohort of COVID-19 researchers took to the site in order to collaborate on their continual learning of the virus.  </p>

          <p class="title"> Research</p>
          <p>My team and I started off by doing research into the difference between light and dark mode and how to switch between the two of them. This was a challenge because the majority of sources were focused on creating a dark mode off of the original light mode design, rather than vice versa like we were planning. It was a very interesting process for us to figure out how to use those sources for dark to light mode. Most of our research focused on color and elevation. We learned which basic colors could be used for light mode design, and how the elevation/stacking of elements should determine color brightness.  </p>

        <div class = "left">
            <p class="title">Design</p>
          <p>Once we had done sufficient research, we went through each element of 1Cademy to determine the best use of the color and elevation that we had studied: </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Background</p>
          <p>We found multiple background image possibilities and presented them to the team. We came to a consensus on one background image and then put a darker overlay on top to reduce distraction and also adhere to the idea that elements at a lower elevation should be darker. In the end, we created a feature that allows the user to choose between a solid color or an image for the background to reduce distractions.  </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Side Bar</p>
          <p>As the element at the highest elevation, we decided to make this color the brightest. We also chose a text color that didnâ€™t distract from the main content. Additionally, we found images for the side bar header that were brighter, which matched the color scheme better than the dark-toned images.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Nodes (main content) </p>
          <p>This element was slightly below the side bar, so the color is slightly darker. We also changed the font color to darker, and increased font weight in order to make it more visible for all users. </p>
          <br>
          <p>As we redesigned these elements, we presented multiple options to the team to find the best choices. After a few weeks of iterations and perfecting the colors, we had a design that was ready to be implemented. </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="title"> Development</p>
          <p>At the point that we had finished the design, more and more users were asking for the light mode option. However, all of the developers for the site were working extensively on other projects for the site. Because of this, I was asked by the head developer if I could work on all of the CSS for the light mode design myself. This was a challenge for me because I had never worked on such as large CSS project, and had only a basic knowledge of the coding language. However, I did agree and after a little bit of set-up from the head developer I was able to single-handedly implement the CSS for light mode.  </p>

            <p class = "title">Final Product</p>
            <p>As of October 2020, light mode has been implemented entirely into the site and is accessible to all users. I am still working on UI design for 1Cademy and we are continually improving the light mode design as we get feedback and come up with solutions to remaining UX pain points on the site.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>At this point, over 90% of users have switched to light mode at some point since its implementation. </p>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class= "left">
          <p class = "title">What I learned</p>
          <p>The main things I learned during this process were in relation to our research on color and elevation. Elements at a higher level should be brighter and vice versa. I also learned that text in light mode should have more weight to improve visibility.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>I also learned a lot about development and CSS implementation. I feel I now have a strong grasp of HTML and CSS and can code confidently using these languages.  </p>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div class= "left">
          <p class = "title">Next Steps</p>
          <p>As I continue working as a part of the 1Cademy team, we are looking at more aspects of the website design, from small design details to larger elements of the platform. Our goal is to be able to present a cohesive experience throughout the site, and have found the best way to solve these problems is through iterative design processes. </p>
          <br>
          <p> We are working on building more user personas and getting feedback from current users as well. Our team is constantly growing together and creating new ideas. I can't wait to see what 1Cademy has in store next!</p>
