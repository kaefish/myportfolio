            <p class="title">The Challenge</p>
            <p>Create a high-fidelity prototype in less than a week.</p>
            <p>In late July of 2020, the founder of NuLimit Contracting reached out to me about creating a high-fidelity prototype of his app. His last designer had dropped out at the last moment, and he had a meeting with developers and possible stakeholders in less than a week. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Timeline: 4 days, July 2020</p>
            <p>Role: UX/UI designer</p>
            <p>Tools: Adobe XD</p>
            <br>
            <p class="title">App Concept</p>
            <p>Nulimit LLC is an application that aims to make contractors more accessible to communities by congregating all information and communication in one place. The concept was created with the founder, Trevor Conlay, realized that there was no consistent way to find and compare contractors in his area. </p>

          <p class="title"> Design Process</p>
          <p>At first, I was given a basic design mockup created on PowerPoint slides that featured main elements of the design, but was not organized well nor was designed in the format of an application. The challenge for me was putting this design into an app format and utilizing the color scheme that the previous designer had gotten started on. </p>
          <br>
          <p>To start off, I spent a good amount of time communicating with the founder on different elements of the app so that I could get a better understanding of his company and his vision of the design. We spoke about aspects of competitors applications that he thought could give his platform an advantage against those competitors. We also worked together on determining what he considered to be the most important elements of his vision, so that I could make sure those elements were emphasized in the design. In order to better understand his vision, I asked questions such as: </p>
        </div>
        <div> 
          <ul>
            <li>Can you explain the basics of the app to me in just a few sentences?</li>
            <li>What are the main goals or objectives of this app?</li>
            <li>Are there any competitors I should look at to get a better understanding of your goals?</li>
            <li>As a past contractor, what are the most important things that you need to communicate with clients and be prepared for a job?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "left">
          <p>From the basic design provided and my developed understanding of the app concept, I built the Nulimit app from scratch on Adobe XD. I started by creating a basic list of elements that were needed within the design and pairing them with the slides that I was provided. Then, I implemented different pages into the prototype, using the predetermined color scheme. Once each page had been created, I used prototyping to connect the user flow of each page. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I sent this first design to the client, and we talked through the use of the app and the elements. He gave me quick feedback to tweak certain elements to better fit his vision. I changed these quickly so that he would have an opportunity to present to his stakeholders and developers within the week.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>One challenge during this design process for me was finding a way to design similar pages for the client and the contractor side. They had to match yet at the same time present different ideas to the user. </p>

          <p class="title"> Final Product</p>
          <p>This application is currently in the development phase (as of October 2020)</p>
          <p>The key features in this finalized design include:</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Login and sign-up pages</p>
          <p>Uses different pages based on whether the user is a client or a contractor, and therefore has different elements based on what is needed to sign up, such as insurance for contractors. </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Chat feature</p>
          <p>A way for users to communicate about the jobs in a free-flowing, safe way within the app. This is the main way for users to interact and ensure that both the client and the contractor are well-informed before starting a job.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Job/contractor discovery page</p>
          <p>Helps users find jobs/contractors within the application. </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Creating job requests</p>
          <p>A more specific way for clients to post a job that they need to get done. This feature also provides helpful information for contractors to understand the basics of any job they choose to take. </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "italic">Notifications</p>
          <p>Helps user catch up from the last time they had used the app so they don’t miss anything important</p>

          <p class = "title">What I learned</p>
          <p>Understanding the goals and objectives of an application is extremely important to design. Without this knowledge, the design may not meet expectations of the client because the focus may be more on elements the designer feels are important, rather than the client. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I also developed a better understanding of Adobe XD and how to use it. I now know how to use most elements of the tool to create beautiful designs. </p>
